I'm really excited to be working on a couple iOS apps that I plan on publishing to the App Store within the next couple months. One is a game, and the other is a Messages app that I've been wanting to make and use for a couple of years.

The game will still require a bit of work and feedback before I publish it, but its going to a lot of fun, just wait and see. That's all I'll say for now.

As for the Messages app, I originally got the idea a couple years ago from a feature within one of my favorite web services. I had planned to do something with the idea like 3 years ago, but the integration within iOS just wasn't there yet. But now as of the keynote earlier this Summer, my idea finally seems possible.

I should also note that if it weren't for my wife reminding me of this idea, I probably wouldn't be working on it right now. So for anything that happens with this app in the future, I have her to thank for it!

I'll be posting more about the apps as I work more on them, so be on the lookout for that.
