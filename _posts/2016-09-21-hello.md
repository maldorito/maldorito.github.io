This my first foray into blogging, and using Github as a publishing platform, so bear with me as I figure this out.

My posts on this website early on will be limited to topics like development, tech news, and occasionally Apple. (Considering the new projects I'm working on, and the product launches coming in September and October, the next couple months might be particularly Apple heavy.) Though as my writing ideas branch out, the content will follow suit. I look forward to seeing what will become of this project in the days to come.
