## [It's Supernatural website](sidroth.org)

This was part of a large collaborative effort with the Messianic Vision team and an outside media group. We worked together to rebrand the website in 2021, and after many revisions and months of hard work we were able to launch this modern and mobile-friendly re-design.

This was the first major WordPress project I was a part of at my most recent job.

I assisted with:

- Design feedback and review
- User Acceptance Testing
- Plugin compatibility testing
- Payment processor testing

## [NTN Math Website](www.ntnmath.com)

This was my first major web project, where I was the sole developer handling the re-design of the company website. 

This project entailed: 

- Working with management to structure the new hierarchy of the website and curriculum media. 
- Utilizing the bootstrap framework to set up the backbone of the site.
- Writing and documenting code to suit the layout and design needs for the site. 
- Making revisions to the site as management requested changes.
