## [NTN Math Website](www.ntnmath.com)

This was my first major web project, where I was the sole developer handling the re-design of the company website. 

This project entailed: 

- Working with management to structure the new hierarchy of the website and curriculum media. 
- Utilizing the bootstrap framework to set up the backbone of the site.
- Writing and documenting code to suit the layout and design needs for the site. 
- Making revisions to the site as management requested changes.
