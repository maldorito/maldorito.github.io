## [ToyInsider website](https://toyinsider.com)

This was my first site build while working at WebDevStudios, which my team worked on in the first quarter of 2023. Starting from the design handoff to my team to the successful launch for the client, we completed the site in 3 months. It was an intense time with lots of work, but my skills as a developer grew immensely during this project.

Here is how I contributed to the team during that time:

- Creating and styling numerous WordPress blocks.
- Building out page templates.
- Refining block code according to Figma designs.
- Performing QA testing on site functionality, accessibility, and load time.

## [It's Supernatural website](https://sidroth.org)

This was part of a large collaborative effort with the Messianic Vision team and an outside media group. We worked together to re-brand the website in 2021, and after many revisions and months of hard work we were able to launch this modern and mobile friendly re-design.

This was the first major WordPress site I was a part of maintaining and working on.

I assisted with:

- Design feedback and review
- User Acceptance Testing
- Plugin compatibility testing
- Payment processor testing

## [NTN Math website](www.ntnmath.com)

This was my first full site web project, where I was the sole developer handling the re-design of the company website. 

This project entailed: 

- Working with management to structure the new hierarchy of the website and curriculum media. 
- Utilizing the bootstrap framework to set up the backbone of the site.
- Writing and documenting code to suit the layout and design needs for the site. 
- Making revisions to the site as management requested changes.
