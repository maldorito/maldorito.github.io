[NTN Math Website](www.ntnmath.com)

This was my first major website project, where I was the sole developer handling the re-design of the company website. This project entailed: working with management to structure the new hierarchy of the website and curriculum media, utilizing the bootstrap framework to set up the backbone of the site, writing and documenting code to suit the layout and design needs for the site, and making revisions to the site as management requested changes.
