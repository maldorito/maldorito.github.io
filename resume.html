    <li>Re-designing and re-structuring company website for: improved creative presentation, better user experience, and responsive design. I first updated the web stack to use modern HTML, CSS, and Java- script. This allowed me to use the BootStrap framework to build the new site layout, and integrate modern user-facing website elements (e.g. carousels, modal windows, and animations). That new codebase, along with some PHP code I wrote, provided me the opportunity to set up a template model that ensured consistency of various components (header and footer, theme colors, page layouts, etc.) over the entirety of the site as changes were made.</li>
